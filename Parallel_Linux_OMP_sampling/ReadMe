#Objective:
  - Add another scheme from FIFO to proportionate
  - Find the appropriate proportions - Do analysis on results
  - Analyse the growth rate of the infectious cases (simulated)
  - Analyse the growth rate of the total submitted cases (observed)
  - Analyse the growth rate of the submitted pandemic cases (simulated)
  - Analyse the bias of the submitted and infectious cases

  - Is it beneficial to look at percent of population infected w.r.t. day?

#Questions:
  - What is the benefit of sampling criteria 1,2,3,4 (first week only scheme)
  - How to evaluate the results from the modification in the sampling criteria
  - What is the use of _sampleClock in SamplingPHL
  - The Life of a sample is less than 3 days (is it 3 from the day of arrival to the lab for test?)

#Solution to update the scheme:
  - In the function SamplingPHL, inside the loop
  if sampling criteria is PROPORTIONATE:
        if (arrival day of sample = today - 2) AND if (#tested_today  <   X):
              ------- Update the tested numbers & erase the sample from the pool -----------

        else if (arrival day of sample = today - 1) AND if (#tested_today  <   Y):
              ------- Update the tested numbers & erase the sample from the pool -----------

        else if (arrival day of sample = today) AND if (#tested_today  <   Z(FULL_CAPACITY)):
              ------- Update the tested numbers & erase the sample from the pool -----------

        else:
                Ignore this sample (DO NOT DISCARD, KEEP IT FOR ANOTHER DAY)

#Updates from last week's discussion:
  - Plot_chart: Growth rate: Using exponential model (a*exp(b*x))
  #- Growth Rate (Submitted data): Compute from observed submitted trend upto day d
  - Similarly obtain growth rate for MSSS
  - And for the tested data (from the matrix file)

#Modifications in the code....
The tested numbers seemed

#April 4th:
1. How to evaluate the tested results:
2. How to compute the proportions
3. Strategy:
    - Initial Allot (X, Y, Z)
    - Recompute allot (considering the available samples for testing and PHL capacity)

    Eg- Capacity(10) - initial allot (6:3:1)
    SamplePoolPHL -   Tested
    6,3,1         -   6,3,1
    10,4,6        -   6,3,1
    5,4,6         -   5,4,1
    7,1,5         -   7,1,2
4. Changes in the files: constants.txt, SimulationRun.cpp - Sampling PHL function
